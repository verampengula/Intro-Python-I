i successfully completed task 1 to task 5. unfortunately i ddint have permission to push. Nonetheless I completed everything i was able to. 
I really struggled with this assignment as i am not too familiar with Github.
This was really good practice, i still inted on practicing more so i am familiar with the platform better and can acrry out expected tasks better and quicker. 
Thank you!
